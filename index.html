>Learning Haskell is not easy. Besides the syntax, concepts, and advanced types, there is a real lack of succinct, accessible references. As I learned Haskell I frequently wanted a quick reference for syntax, keywords and other language elements. <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinereport"
  >The Haskell Report</a
  >, while very thorough, wasn&rsquo;t quite it.</p
><p
>For that reason I&rsquo;ve created <a href="/static/CheatSheet.pdf"
  >this cheatsheet</a
  >. It&rsquo;s intended for beginning to intermediate Haskell programmers to use as a quick-reference guide for syntax, keywords or other language issues. You can obtain it in three different ways:</p
><ul
><li
  >Download directly in PDF format: <a href="CheatSheet.pdf"
    >CheatSheet.pdf</a
    ></li
  ><li
  >As a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/CheatSheet"
    >Haskell package on HackageDB</a
    >.<ul
    ><li
      >After downloading, unpack the tarball and the PDF is inside.</li
      ></ul
    ></li
  ><li
  >Using cabal install with &ldquo;<tt>cabal install cheatsheet</tt>&rdquo;. Afterwards, run the &ldquo;<tt>cheatsheet</tt>&rdquo; program and it will tell you where the PDF is located.</li
  ></ul
><p
>The guide itself is written as a &ldquo;literate&rdquo; Haskell file, meaning it is directly executable. That file is available when using the latter two options above.</p
